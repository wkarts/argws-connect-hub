Hub is looking forward to working with security researchers worldwide to keep Hub and our users safe. If you have found an issue in our systems/applications, please reach out to us.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We use [huntr.dev](https://huntr.dev/) for security issues that affect our project. If you believe you have found a vulnerability, please disclose it via this [form](https://huntr.dev/bounties/disclose). This will enable us to review the vulnerability, fix it promptly, and reward you for your efforts.

If you have questions about the process, use the private security reporting channel defined for the HUB installation.

Please try your best to describe a clear and realistic impact for your report, and please don't open any public issues on GitHub or social media; we're doing our best to respond through Huntr as quickly as possible.

> Note: Please use the email for questions related to the process. Disclosures should be done via [huntr.dev](https://huntr.dev/)
